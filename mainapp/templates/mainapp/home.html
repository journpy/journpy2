                        <strong>This program is geared towards training fullstack developers with Python.</strong> In
                        this program, you will learn backend development with Python using Django
                        framework. You will learn to style your web app using Bootstrap. It also
                        includes a crash course on Python for those that need it to get you familiar with Python as a
                        prerequisite for learning Django. This program comes with assignments and quizzes with a final
                        project to build and host your blog app. At the end of the program, you will be awarded a
                        certificate of completion. The duration of this program is 3 months.

        <p>
            In the 1980â€™s, Seymour Papert introduced the term constructionism as a learning model based on the theory of
            constructivism. Constructionism is a learning theory in which students learn by creating shareable
            artefacts.</p>
        <p>It advocates that students can learn better by manipulating objects and creating artefacts at different
            phases of learning. Students learn in a practical and hands-on manner as opposed to the traditional method
            of teaching. According to Papert, the primary tool used in constructionist learning is the computer.</p>
        <p>The computer is the object that learners use to think with as they create personal digital artefacts that
            represents their own learning. Students enjoy constructionist learning because it gives them ownership of
            their learning as they use technology to create their own learning experiences. Constructionism promotes
            time management in learning. It also allows students to learn from their mistakes which is similar to the
            concept of debugging - the act of identifying and correcting errors in a computer program.</p>
        <p class="lead p-color">Our Python for Mathematics program helps students learn math through coding in an
            integrated learning approach that is based on the learning theory of Constructionism. Please see the blog
            section for more on this.</p>
